Sup guys ;)
So you have 2 endpoints to check: 
- http://test.local => will test xml format part
- http://test.local/json => will test json format part

The most interesting files are:
- IndexController.php
- HttpClient.php
- CreditScoreTransformer.php

Have fun <3

P.S. folks, did not worked with XML for soooo long, lol, maybe some stupid approach was made xD

Total time spent ~3 hours)
